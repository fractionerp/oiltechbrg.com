      <h3><span>M Series Modular Thrust Bearings</span></h3>
      <p>Modular thrust bearings use different numbers of thrust pads to make up the thrust bearing. The larger the bearing diameter, the larger the number of pads. Modular thrust bearings can be designed and manufactured with both flooded and direct lubrication and from a variety of designs to allow for offset pivots and different materials.</p>

        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <p>
          Suitable for pumps, gearboxes, motors and small steam turbines.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Size Range</h4>
        <p>
          M Series bearings are available from 50mm up to 500mm internal diameter in both centre and offset pivot designs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Lubrication</h4>
        <p>
          M Series bearings can be manufactured with direct (low loss) lubrication through the pad retaining stops, or by flooded lubrication.
        </p>
        <h4>Instrumentation</h4>
        <p>
          Pre-machined pads ready to accept your instrumentation or complete supply of bearings with instrumentation installed.
