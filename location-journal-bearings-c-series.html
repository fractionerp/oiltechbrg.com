      <h3><span>Locating Journal Bearing - C Series</span></h3>
      <p>Location bearings are journal bearings with whitemetal faces used to provide a location for the rotor. The axial faces can only carry minimal loads, but enable the support of minor axial loading and ensure accurate location of the rotating assembly. If the location faces are design with taper lands the axial load can be increased. Our C series range are based on DIN standard bearings. They are available in standard sizes or can be customised to suit your application. They are manufactured from carbon steel and lined with BS3332/A or to your specifications.</p>

        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <p>
          Suitable for pumps, gearboxes, motors and small steam turbines.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Size Range</h4>
        <p>
          Available from 50mm to 300mm bore with various L/D ratios.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Bore Profiles</h4>
        <p>
          These bearings can be designed with cyclindrical, ellipical(lemon), offset halves or muli-lobe profiles.
        </p>
        <h4>Location Faces</h4>
        <p>
          Location faces are coating in whitemetal from a centrifugal casting process. They can be machined with oil distribution slots and taper lands to provide high axial load capacity.
