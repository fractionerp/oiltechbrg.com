      <h3><span>J Series Equalising Thrust Bearings.</span></h3>
      <p>Equalising or self-levelling thrust bearings have significant advantages over standard tilt pad design. The series of internal segments that link the pads together, allow for perfect alignment or levelling of the thrust face. This ensure the thrust pads can share the load equally and operate at higher overall loads.<br>
        Our J Series equalising bearings are inter-changeable with common designs in the market place and can be made from standard steel backed or copper-chrome backed thrust pads.</p>
