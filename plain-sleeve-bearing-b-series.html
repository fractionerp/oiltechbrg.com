      <h3><span>Plain Journal Bearings - Type B</span></h3>
      <p>Plain journal bearings in our B series range are based on DIN standard bearings. They feature a flanged location diameter which provides accurate axial location. They are available in standard sizes or can be customised to suit your application. They are manufactured from carbon steel and lined with BS3332/A or to your specifications.</p>

        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <p>
          Suitable for pumps, gearboxes, motors and small steam turbines.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Size Range</h4>
        <p>
          Available from 50mm to 300mm bore with various L/D ratios.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Bore Profiles</h4>
        <p>
          These bearings can be designed with cyclindrical, ellipical(lemon), offset halves or muli-lobe profiles.
        </p>
        <h4>Pressure Fed Oil Lubrication</h4>
        <p>
          All journal bearings in our A, B and C ranges use pressure fed lubrication. Oil is pumped through the bearing housing and into the radial oil feed holes in the bearing to be distributed by the oil grooves. Typically they are designed with ISO VG32 or VG46 lubricants.
