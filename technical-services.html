        <h3>Troubleshooting Rotating Equipment</h3>
        <p>
          Often a client will experience a problem with a machine during operation that causes an alarm, trip or the machine will continue with run but with abnormal conditions. The other common scenario is a client that is unable to reach operational speed or load after an overhaul due to temperature or vibration limits. Understanding these and the failure mechanisms and the scenario for the conditions can help inform when to shut down machinery.

        <h3>Upgrades and Re-rating</h3>
        <p>
          Modernising or revamping of old turbomachinery to improve efficiency can lead to babbit bearings needing to be re-rated within the same working package as the original design. We have experience in re-rating and upgrading bearing designs to allow for increased load, improved stability and lower running temperatures.
